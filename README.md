# Introduction

This is MyMovies. A movie-journal app which allows users to make lists keeping track of their favourite films while sharing them with other users.

# Objectives

To build a full stack tracking-type web application with user logins, authentication and the ability to have unique profiles. I wanted this app to be a place where fellow movie buffs could track their movies and share their favourite with others.
